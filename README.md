# TGIF-web-app
'Transparent government in fact, is the first web-app I ever made in vanilla JS as a part of the assignments in the Ubiqum bootcamp. 

The application uses data from APIs from ProPublica, to display the 113th Congress of USA . All the data is dynamically generated and so are the tables. 

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, JSON, APIs, Bootstrap.
